toodledo-java
-------------

This is an _UNOFFICIAL_ implementation of the www.toodledo.com REST API in Java.
Coded by me (Marc) phlegias@gmail.com, and with various contributions from other people who helped via Github.

Usage
-----
This is basically a library with a nice and helpfull (hopefully) API to work with Toodledo. Easily extensible and bla bla bla.

Libs
----
I'm using ivy for library dependency. If you don't know what it is or how to setup it have a look at http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/latest-milestone/install.html . If for any reason you cannot install it you'll need to hack the build.xml and place the libs in the /lib directory.
